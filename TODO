MMU+X: Features we can and probably should add

Watch the FINDA and door sensors at all times. Print status realtime
on LCD when loading. Watch if they're changing state when they
shouldn't be.  We may be able to alert users of
intermittency due to subtle miscalibration.

DONE When selecting filament at the MMU, actually tell the bloody MK3 about it.

'default' filament gcode should use the current filament, not switch to filament 1

MMU calibration menu items:
Repeat autosetup
idler offset
selector offset

lights cheatsheet!

Better state mapping of all failure possibilities, and recovery options that make sense

Allow cancellation of non-timeout operations like filament load

don't just light LEDs: send status to MK3 that it can print.

Allow cancellation of prints from OctoPrint; will require intuiting
when we're printing gcode fed in from USB
